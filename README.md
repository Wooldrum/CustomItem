ItemAtLocation

A custom item plugin used by the Realm of Elderna Minecraft Server

I do not recommend you use this plugin, as it is very not good, but if there is no other option, then feel free to use it.

The commands are as follows (by default only usable by players with administrator permissions):

/itematlocation setlocation: Sets a target location to which players need to move in order to receive an item.

Usage: /itematlocation setlocation     (can also use ~ for relative coordinates).

/itematlocation setitem: Sets the type of item that will be given to players at the specified location.

Usage: /itematlocation setitem  

/itematlocation setcooldown: Sets the cooldown time in seconds for how often a player can receive the reward item at the specified location.

Usage: /itematlocation setcooldown  

/itematlocation setradius: Sets the radius in blocks within which players will receive the reward item at the specified location.

Usage: /itematlocation setradius  

/itematlocation removelocation: Removes the previously set target location so that no reward is given.

Usage: /itematlocation removelocation
