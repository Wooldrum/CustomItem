# ItemAtLocation
A custom item plugin used by the Realm of Elderna Minecraft Server

I do not reccomend you use this plugin, as it is very *not good* but if there is no other option, then feel free to use it. 

The commands are as follows (by default only usable by players with administrator permissions): 

/setlocation: Sets the target location to which players need to move in order to receive an item

    Usage: /setlocation <x> <y> <z> (can also use ~ for relative coordinates).

/setitem: Sets the type of item that will be given to players at the location set.

    Usage: /setitem <item>

/setcooldown: Sets the cooldown time in seconds for how often a player can receive the reward item at the set location.

    Usage: /setcooldown <seconds>

/removelocation: Removes the previously set target location so that no reward is given.

    Usage: /removelocation
